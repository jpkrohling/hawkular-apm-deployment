= Hawkular APM Deployment scripts

This is an assorted collection of deployment scripts. These might or not work at any given point in time,
and are mostly helpers.

== Deploying an OpenShift cluster with Hawkular APM

[source,bash]
----
$ ansible-playbook hawkular-apm-ansible-openshift.yml
----

Try experimenting with the `ansible-vars.yml` file!

== Deploying Hawkular APM into an existing OpenShift cluster

Assuming that `oc login` has been performed, this command can be used to deploy the Hawkular APM services
into an existing OpenShift cluster:
[source,bash]
----
$ oc create -f hawkular-apm-openshift.yml
----

To remote the items created by the command above, this can be executed:
[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete -f hawkular-apm-openshift.yml
----

For the clustering to work, don't forget to `sudo iptables -F`.
